			<h1>Welcome to my game!</h1>
			<h2>How it works.</h2>
			<p>In this game you and your opponent will build an army and engage in combat until one of you emerges victorious.
			Your armies will comprise eight units of the following unit types: Swordsmen, Bowmen, Spearmen and Horsemen.
			You will select your units in turns, allowing you to tailor your army to the threat of your opponent.</p>
			<h2>Army selection.</h2>
			<p>Player one will get the first choice of unit, after which player two will select two and then player one chooses another two. 
			You will continue to select two units of your desired unit type until player one chooses their last two, leaving player one to choose their final unit. 
			Throughout the selection process you will have the choice between Swordsmen, Bowmen, Spearmen and Horsemen which have the bonuses listed below.</p>
			<h2>Unit combat.</h2>
			<p>Once units are selected you will go to the combat phase. 
			Player one will start by selecting their attacks and defences and then commit to their moves, afterwhich player two will do the same.
			The attacks will then commence and damage will be dealt to the other side.
			This process will continue in turns until </p>
			<h2>Unit bonuses.</h2>
			<p>As said above, some units have advantages over other units. 
			Swordsmen will get a +50% damage bonus when fighting Spearmen, 
			Spearmen will get a +100% damage bonus when fighting Horsemen, 
			and Horsemen will get a +50% damage bonus when fighting both Swordsmen and Bowmen. 
			Last but not least, Bowmen will get a +100% damage bonus when they are not attacked by another unit, 
			and a -50% damage penalty when not attacked by another unit.</p>
			<h2>Other bonuses.</h2>
			<p>In addition to the unit bonuses, there are also outnumbering and health bonuses and penalties.
			If an attacker has multiple untis attacking a single target they will get a damage multiplier of n^(1/2) where n is the number of units.
			If a defender has multiple units defending against enemies they will get a damage multiplier of n^(2/3) where n is the number of units.
			Lastly, the damage output of a unit will be modified relative to the health of the unit and the average health of any enemies it is fighting.</p>
